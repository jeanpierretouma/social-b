### What I learned

This project was a gig I worked on and it helped me get a glimpse of what it means to be a frontend developer or a web developer in general. I learned to collaborate with the business owner and ask questions to understand their needs and goals to set a plan to work on the project. I learned about the process of making a website from scratch. While designing and building this project I learned about the different stages that a designer and developer must go through to get to the final product with the best possible outcome that serves the users of the website and the business behind it.

### Continued development

I'm satisfied with the way I designed and built this project because it was my first gig and the client was happy with the end result. It looks quite close to the design which tackles all users' challenges and it works well.

In the future I'll implement JS form validation to increase the security and usability of the contact form.

### Useful resources

- [A Complete Guide to Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid) - This article helped me understand the different ways to build a layout with CSS Grid. I'd recommend it to people looking for different use cases of CSS Grid.
